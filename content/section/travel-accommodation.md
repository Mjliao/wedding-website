**Please fly into Honolulu Internation Airport HNL (Daniel K. Inouye International Airport). We recommend arriving either Tuesday, March 5th or Wednesday March 6th.**

<br>

The airport is about 30 minutes from Waikiki. If you would like to explore the island, we recommend that you book a car rental from the airport ahead of time. Alternatively, if you just plan on staying in Waikiki, a car rental is not necessary as it will be possible to taxi to every location in the wedding.
